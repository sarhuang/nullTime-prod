### What you planned to do
* [#69](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/69) 
* [#70](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/70) 
* [#71](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/71) 
* [#72](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/72) 
* [#73](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/73) 
* [#74](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/74) 

### What you did not do
* Didnt create handlers for every single enpoint, still need to work on delete endpoints, they are more complicated than I expected

### What problems you encountered
AWS doesn't care about their customers, I shouldn't have to go to 900 different 3rd party sites to figure out how to use their software. Much of this sprint was spent assisting Kuba throughout dealing with the AWS drama. Luckily everything has been resolved and we can start really digging into the coding of the endpoints.

### Files you worked on
* aws/api/lobby/src/main/kotlin/documentation.md
* aws/api/lobby/src/main/kotlin/endpointCreate.md
* aws/api/lobby/src/main/kotlin/endpointDelete.md
* aws/api/lobby/src/main/kotlin/endpointFinish.md
* aws/api/lobby/src/main/kotlin/endpointCardSubmit.md
* aws/api/lobby/src/main/kotlin/endpointCardDelete.md
* aws/api/lobby/src/main/kotlin/endpointCardModify.md

### What you accomplished
Learned much of how api's worked and got to assist Kuba through much of the initialization of AWS tools. Now in the future I can be pretty confident I can do much of this on my own and potentially manage my own AWS services if I am so inclined.

Created many of the endpoints that will be expanded later into the main inner workings of the api. Each endpoint can detect if it has been called and return data that it has been called, now all that is left is to have each endpoint interface with the database.
