## Time's up

### Summary
The project is to make a digital version for a popular party game known as Time's Up or Fishbowl. It would allow the user to enter a link and create a game that others would be able to join.

### Problem
The game is a lot of fun, but it is a pain to setup. Not always do you have enough paper and pencils on the spot. The game would allow to start game with either the words already in the database, or allow to create your own, without the need for the paper.

## How to Run the Game

Make sure you have Node installed (any version).
If this is your first time running the app, run `npm install` first while in the `null-time-web` folder.
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## How to Play
Once at the home page, press "Host Game"
Once the next page is open, press "Create Local Game"
You will then see a card list, press "Add Card" to add as many cards as you like. I recommend about 5 per person playing
To change the value on a card, click the card and enter a new value
Once you have your cards, press "Start Game"
The game consists of 3 rounds, each round is explained in game as you play

### Features
* Responsive web app that allows the game to be played
* Instant game with the use of the words from database
* Create words for the game using multiuple devices
* Store the selected words after the game is over

### Tech
* Angular
* Typescript
* SASS
* Node
* AWS
* Kotlin 

### Target
* Young people that know the game, but don't have time to set it up
* People who lack resources to set up the game
* People who want to keep track of the keywords they have played in the past
