Background:
The hit social party game Time's Up is quite fun to play, but playing it comes with the unfortunate downside of a lot of setup.

Product Overview:
NullTime is a digital version of Time's Up that helps eliminate all the setup usually required to play Time's Up. 
It will handle the card creation, game phases and rounds, and match scoring.

Features:
Game Card Component (Issue #10):
As a user, I want to be able to have a digital representation of a game card, so that I can use it to play the game.

Game Moderator Component (Issue #11):
As a user, I want to be able to modify the current state of the game in the middle of the game, so that it's easier to correct mistakes in scoring in the middle of the game

Game Lobby Component (Issue #7):
As a user, I want a pre game lobby, so that I have a place to enter game cards to use in the game

Mid-game instructions (Issue #78):

Hidden Player Cards (Issue #51):
As a user, I want to be able to hide the cards entered into the game card list, so that during local games the other players cannot cheat

Gameplay Soundeffects (Issue #80):
