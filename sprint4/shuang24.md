### What you accomplished
**Settle on a visual theme for the game (#53)**<br />
For this issue, I redid majority of the visuals of the website. Instead of a stationary background, I set a video as the background. I created an original logo and tried to set all the colors into a cohesive color scheme. With the background, it was hard to see the buttons and text, so I added a black box with white border background to match the logo. I added these boxes to the starting join game page, lobby, round pages, turn pages, actual gameplay, and results page. I tried to size them to fit mobile devices. The round and results pages also include diagrams that supplement the instructions and fill up the space.

**Lobby: Add game music (#80)**<br />
I chose royalty free music that would fit the game's aesthetic. You can play and pause the music with the sound icon, and the icon actually changes depending on the state.

**Join/Home page: Create a credits page (#81)**<br />
In the join page, there is an info icon that shows our names and credits to the background video and music.
