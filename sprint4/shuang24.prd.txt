# Product Requirements Document
Name: Sarah Huang

Product Name: Null Time

## Background
The game is a lot of fun, but it is a pain to setup. Not always do you have enough paper and pencils on the spot.
The game would allow to play the game without paper. The application is great for young people that know the game 
but don't have time to set it up or lack the resources.

## Project Overview
Null Time is a digital version of Time's Up that helps eliminate all the setup usually required to play Time's Up. 
It will handle the card creation, game phases and rounds, and match scoring.

## Features

1. Join Game via Game Pin (Issue #3)
As a user, I want to be able to enter a game pin and be able to add words to our game so multiple people can add many cards to the game.

2. Digital Game Card (Issue #10, #15)
As a user, I want to be able to add and edit a card with words I want to add to the game so we can play without paper and pencil.

3. Pop ups (#33)
As a user, I want to be warned when I am doing an action that could erase our cards or doing a wrong action.

4. Instructions at Every Round (#78)
As a user, I want to be told what the instructions are for each round as they change every round.

5. Game Moderator (Issue #11)
As a user, I want to be able to click a card and change the team it is assigned to in case scoring mishaps occur.

6. Local Lobby (Issue #14)
As a user, I want to be able to play a local game that doesn't require my friends to have phones to play.

7. Team Scores on Gameplay Page (Issue #76)
As a user, I want to know the scores of both teams throughout all the rounds rather the end so I know how hard to play.

8. Game Sound Effects and Music (Issue #79, #80)
As a user, I want the game to have music and sound effects so the game is more engaging and gives back audio feedback for options I've clicked.
