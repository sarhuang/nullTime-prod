Background:
A great party game called "Fishbowl" is great at unity people together.
However, it requires dozens of minutes to properly setup. The nullTime
aims to solve this issue.



Overview:
NullTime allows one person to set up a game on their mobile device.
After creating a lobby, every person is able to add their own cards to
that lobby from their own device using a lobby-key given after lobby
creation. Then, the owner can start the game, creating a deck of cards
from the ones submitted by other players, and goes to the game part.
Here the game can be completely played on one divice, where all the
cards are managed automatically, allowing for management in between
the different stages of the game.



Features:

Host a game:
As a party leader, I want to be able to create a game with an easily
sharable code, to allow ease of access to other players.

Contribute Cards:
As a player, I want to be able to submit my cards simultaniously with
other players, to expand the game and save time.

Delete Cards:
As a player, I want to be able to revoke my submission, in case I
have contributed wrong cards.

Start a game:
As a party leader, I want to be able to start the game with all the
words, to proceed to the start of the first round.

Play rounds:
As a player, I want to be able to go through different rounds of the
game on the leading device, to allow for fluent gameplay

Moderate:
As a party leader, I want to be able to revise the round state, to
make sure any mistakes have been fixed
