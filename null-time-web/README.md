Description:
Play the game Time's Up in your browser! You no longer need to have paper and pencil, along with the many minutes of setup, to play this game. Just add as many game cards as you want and press play. The game will give you instructions as you go.

## How to Run the Game

Make sure you have Node installed (any version).
If this is your first time running the app, run `npm install` first.
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## How to Play
Once at the home page, press "Host Game"
Once the next page is open, press "Create Local Game"
You will then see a card list, press "Add Card" to add as many cards as you like. I recommend about 5 per person playing
To change the value on a card, click the card and enter a new value
Once you have your cards, press "Start Game"
The game consists of 3 rounds, each round is explained in game as you play
