# Sprint 1

Kuba Zeligowski • huncfut • nullTime

### What you planned to do
* Learn Kotlin
* Understand different server architectures [#21](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/21)
* Choose Cloud Provider [#22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/22)
* Create Template [#23](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/23)
* Configure building script [#25](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/25)
* Write First Handler [#24](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/24)
* Write First Test [#26](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/26)

### What you did not do
* Build Script is not working properly – the tests are not run
* Handler is not an actual handler, rather a complete dummy class

### What problems you encountered
Learning new language is way harder if you learn other new technologies at the same time. There is no tutorials for serverless kotlin RESTful API's on AWS for complete begginners (understandable). Thus, it was hard to actually understand what is going on rather than simply copying the starter template.

### Issues you worked on
* Understand different server architectures [#21](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/21)
* Choose Cloud Provider [#22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/22)
* Create Template [#23](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/23)
* Configure building script [#25](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/25)
* Write First Handler [#24](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/24)
* Write First Test [#26](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/26)

### Files you worked on
* null-time-api/\* – every single file was created by me during this sprint

### What you accomplished
I learned some basics in kotlin – most important key features, not actual project developement. This one was fairly simple, just reading the documentation. I also grew more weary of different approaches for API's and just Full-Stack Developement. Rather than just knowing the key term, I know what the ideas behind different approaches are, and what makes them different. I also understand how AWS works and what kind of services will we need for the project to run in an organized way. Gateway API's are going to invoke different Lambda functions that will connect to their DynamoDB tables, basically following the microservice structure. I was able to create the gradle project structure on my own, rather than just cloning one from the internet. This way I know what each line of code is responsible for (on the surface) and I have chosen the directory structure that I find reasonable. Creating first handler and a test for it gave me some peace of mind, that I have written at least a few lines of kotlin code.
