# Sprint 1

Name: Ryland Seagraves
Github ID: Ryland-Seagraves
Group Name: nullTime

### What you planned to do
- #19 [[Backend] Generate game code](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/19)
- Setup query framework for client requests
- Setup entry arrays to hold and return to users

### What you did not do
- Setup entry arrays to hold and return to users

### What problems you encountered
I am new to the concept of anything outside of the thought process and code surrounding C++ and labs in college. Much of this sprint was spent learning how API's function, how to code in Kotlin, and how Java applications operate in general

### Issues you worked on
- #19 [[Backend] Generate game code](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/19)

### Files you worked on
null-time-api-temp/GenCode.kt

### What you accomplished
I learned how to code in JVM Languages and differences to be found between them and C++.
I then learned how API's function and how coding practices must be changed when working with them.
Lastly I developed a room code generator that will later be used to return codes to users when creating lobbies.
