- #7 [Game Lobby Component](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/7)
### What problems you encountered
I have been struggling with maneuvering GitHub and learning about things like issues. I do not have familiarity with javascript/typescript, html, css, or Angular. The game structure, though largely understood, is not rigorously developed. Lots of functionality has not been implemented yet so I couldn't really add it to my webpage.
### Issues you worked on
- #18 [Create Turn Page for when a player is taking their turn](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/18)
### Files you worked on
- turn-page.html
### What you accomplished
I played the game Time's Up! with other team members while taking notes to get a feel for the mechanics of the game. I contributed to the brainstorm session to design the game structure. I learned about javascript/typescript, primarily from Harrison. I created the turn page without functionality.
