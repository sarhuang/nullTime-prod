### What problems you encountered
I am new to Angular, so it took me some time to figure it out.
I have not made a game as a web app before so it's taken some time to plan out the technical details.

### Issues you worked on
- #6 [Create Base Angular App](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/6)
- #9 [Game Card List](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/9)
- #10 [Game Card Component](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/10)

### Files you worked on
src/app/game-card
src/app/game-card-list
src/app/game-wrapper
src/gameHelper/interfaces.ts

### What you accomplished
First I create the base Angular App and got it working with Scss files. I then created 3 components: game-card, game-card-list, and game-wrapper.
Most of the functionality came from the game-card and game-card-list components. First I wrote an interface for the cards themselves to hold data.
I then created the card component to display its value in a little container. I then added the functionality to edit the card when clicked.
I then added the ability to iterate through cards and display them in the game-card-list component.
In conclusion: We can create, display, and edit cards for the game.
