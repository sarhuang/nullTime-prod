### What problems you encountered
- It has been a long time since I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Issue #5 involves servers, so I'm unsure if I should work on that or someone from the backend team.

### Issues you worked on
- [#2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/2) Create Initial Game Lobby Page
- [#3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/3) Create initial Player Join Game page

### Files you worked on
- lobby/src/html/lobby.html
- lobby/src/html/joinGame.html
- lobby/src/css/lobby.css
- lobby/src/css/joinGame.css


### What you accomplished
I created the initial Game Lobby and Player Join Game pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They are just separated pages with no functionality. Since I was not sure of the final design, they are inspired by Kahoot as we wanted our lobby to be similar to that game.
