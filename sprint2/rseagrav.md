# Sprint 2

Name: Ryland Seagraves
Github ID: Ryland-Seagraves
Group Name: nullTime

### What you planned to do
- #29 [Create Card class](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/29)
- #30 [Create Instance class](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/30)
- #31 [Create GameTools class](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/31)

### What you did not do
- N/A. After completing issues #29, #30, and #31 I helped Kuba and recapped everything that is expected of the api side of the project

### What problems you encountered
No big issues, only smaller things such as vscode struggling to understand kotlin syntax and refusing to render properly. Only slightly slowed down coding process until dowloading patch

### Issues you worked on
- #29 [Create Card class](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/29)
- #30 [Create Instance class](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/30)
- #31 [Create GameTools class](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/nullTime/issues/31)

### Files you worked on
null-time-api-temp/GameTools.kt
null-time-api-temp/InstanceClass.kt

### What you accomplished
I made all the classes needed for the api to work. Every possible thing that the api could ever need can now be run in a single call thanks to the class structure.
This has set things to be really easy for the next 2 sprints (3 and 4). Because of this, in sprint 3 I can prioritize linking all these classes and functions to server requests (which means that the server should be completely operational disregarding card storage), and in sprint 4 I should be able to just prioritize card storage (reading and writing cards in batches).
